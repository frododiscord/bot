<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many bots out there that can do games, but this one aimes to bring them all together. It is currently being worked on by Daniel Howard and Noah Lavelle for fun and to develop skills. It is being constantly updated and will soon have features like minigames - RPS, TTT, number games etc, and a more advanced party system for server-wide games like Werewolves. We also intend to create an economy based game.

### Features

The bot currently has quite a few games. The full list currently is
* Connect 4,
* Akinator,
* Hangman,
* Rock Paper Scissors,
* Trivia,
* Tick Tack Toe,
* Countdown style anagrams.
* Chase the Ace - Almost completed,
All of these are within the discord chat and are quite polished. The current major games in development is Wearwolves and a set of card games. The bot does not only provide games though. 
There are also many different simple text commands like joke, fact, fortune, insult and most importantly, chucknorris. The bot also has per server configs for things like prefixes and also full server backups! This covers rolls, settings, channels and even messages!
